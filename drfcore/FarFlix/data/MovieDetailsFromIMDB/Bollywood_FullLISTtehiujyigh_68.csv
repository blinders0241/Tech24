One day his daughter brings home an infant (Krish Parekh) and the mother of the infant has disappeared and cannot be found nowhere.

However the Pandit's wife Parvati (Supriya Pathak Kapur) has by now developed a soft spot for the young child and requests her husband if they can keep and raise the child if as their own. Hesitant at first, the priest reluctantly agrees as his wife lies to him that the baby is the son of a Brahmin. Slowly, the child wins over everyone hearts in the house including Pandit Chaturvedi who finds a son, a disciple and a best friend in the child. The story takes a turn when the baby's mother returns to claim him back, and much to the shock of Pandit Chaturvedi, the lady is a Muslim. The child who they'd fondly named Karthik is in fact Mustafa.
