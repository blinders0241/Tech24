A reason. A drive; behind these deaths and he was far from done. Fearing the next attack, the Commissioner calls upon their best bet to catch Vir. DCP Shivansh is what a proper policeman looks like. Strong, Courageous, Patriotic and most importantly, ""Clean."" And of course, he's the best at what he does. What follows is a succession of events that will test his Probity to the fullest. He is up against Vir, who is a vigilante and will stop at nothing to complete his mission. This confrontation of epic proportions will take us through the corrupt underbelly of the Financial Capital.

Or was there order in this chaos? There's a lot at stake. Along with the lives of numerous policemen, the public's faith in the police's capability to keep them safe is also at stake.
